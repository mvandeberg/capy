/** Defers a coroutine body until awaited, then runs it inline on the caller's thread.

    Use `task<T>` as the return type for coroutines that perform I/O
    and return a value of type `T`. The coroutine body does not start
    executing until the task is awaited, enabling efficient composition
    without unnecessary eager execution.

    The task participates in the I/O awaitable protocol: when awaited,
    it receives the caller's executor and stop token, propagating them
    to nested `co_await` expressions. This enables cancellation and
    proper completion dispatch across executor boundaries.

    @par Await-effects

    Let `t` be a `task<T>`. `co_await t` always suspends the awaiting
    coroutine, then transfers control directly into the task's coroutine
    body on the current thread; no executor operation is posted. The task
    records the caller's environment (executor, stop token, and frame
    allocator) by pointer rather than copying it. It propagates that
    environment to every `co_await` inside the body.

    The body runs until it returns or exits via an exception. Control
    then transfers directly back to the awaiting coroutine, again
    without an executor operation.

    `task` never inspects the stop token; it only propagates it. A task
    body observes a stop request through the results of the operations it
    awaits, or by reading the token itself. See @ref quitter for a task
    that stops its own body.

    @par Await-returns
    The value the body passed to `co_return`, moved out of the task, or
    nothing when `T` is `void`.

    If the body exits via an unhandled exception, that exception is
    rethrown instead.

    @par Await-postcondition
    The task's coroutine has run to completion and is suspended at its
    final suspend point. The task still owns the frame, but not the
    result: the await moves it out, so a task must not be awaited twice.

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.
    Shared objects: Unsafe.

    @par Example

    @code
    task<int> compute_value()
    {
        auto [ec, n] = co_await stream.read_some( buf );
        if( ec )
            co_return 0;
        co_return process( buf, n );
    }

    task<> run_session( tcp_socket sock )
    {
        int result = co_await compute_value();
        // ...
    }
    @endcode

    @tparam T The result type. Use `task<>` for `task<void>`.
