/** Registers, looks up, and shuts down `service` objects owned by a derived context.

    An execution context represents a place where function objects are
    executed. It provides a service registry where polymorphic services
    can be stored and retrieved by type. Each service type may be stored
    at most once. Services may specify a nested `key_type` to enable
    lookup by a base class type.

    Derived classes such as `io_context` extend this to provide
    execution facilities like event loops and thread pools. Derived
    class destructors must call `shutdown()` and `destroy()` to ensure
    proper service cleanup before member destruction.

    @par Service Lifecycle
    Services are created on first use via `use_service()` or explicitly
    via `make_service()`. During destruction, `shutdown()` is called on
    each service in reverse order of creation, then `destroy()` deletes
    them. Both functions are idempotent.

    @par Thread Safety
    Service registration and lookup functions are thread-safe.
    The `shutdown()` and `destroy()` functions are not thread-safe
    and must only be called during destruction.

    @par Example
    @code
    struct file_service : execution_context::service
    {
    protected:
        void shutdown() override {}
    };

    struct posix_file_service : file_service
    {
        using key_type = file_service;

        explicit posix_file_service(execution_context&) {}
    };

    class io_context : public execution_context
    {
    public:
        ~io_context()
        {
            shutdown();
            destroy();
        }
    };

    io_context ctx;
    ctx.make_service<posix_file_service>();
    ctx.find_service<file_service>();       // returns posix_file_service*
    ctx.find_service<posix_file_service>(); // also works

    /** Gives a derived service a `shutdown()` hook, run when its owning `execution_context` is destroyed.

        Services provide extensible functionality to an execution context.
        Each service type can be registered at most once. Services are
        created via `use_service()` or `make_service()` and are owned by
        the execution context for their lifetime.

        Derived classes must implement the pure virtual `shutdown()` member
        function, which is called when the owning execution context is
        being destroyed. The `shutdown()` function should release resources
        and cancel outstanding operations without blocking.

        @par Deriving from service
        @li Implement `shutdown()` to perform cleanup.
        @li Accept `execution_context&` as the first constructor parameter.
        @li Optionally define `key_type` to enable base-class lookup.

        @code
        struct my_service : execution_context::service
