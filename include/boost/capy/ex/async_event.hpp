/*  async_event implementation notes
    =================================

    Same cancellation pattern as async_mutex (see that file for the
    full discussion on claimed_, stop_cb lifetime, member ordering,
    and threading assumptions).

    Key difference: set() wakes ALL waiters (broadcast), not one.
    It pops every waiter from the list and posts the ones it
    claims. Waiters already claimed by a stop callback are skipped.

    Because set() pops all waiters, a canceled waiter may have been
    removed from the list by set() before its await_resume runs.
    This requires a separate in_list_ flag (unlike async_mutex where
    active_ served double duty). await_resume only calls remove()
    when in_list_ is true.
*/

namespace boost {
namespace capy {

/** Queues coroutines in `wait()` and resumes all of them when `set()` is called.

    This event provides a way to notify multiple coroutines that some
    condition has occurred. When a coroutine awaits an unset event, it
    suspends and is added to a wait queue. When the event is set, all
    waiting coroutines are resumed.

    @par Cancellation

    When a coroutine is suspended waiting for the event and its stop
    token is triggered, the waiter completes with `error::canceled`
    instead of waiting for `set()`.

    Cancellation only applies while the coroutine is suspended in the
    wait queue. If the event is already set when `wait()` is called,
    the wait completes immediately even if the stop token is already
    signaled.

    @par Zero Allocation

    No heap allocation occurs for wait operations.

    @par Thread Safety

    Distinct objects: Safe.@n
    Shared objects: Unsafe.

    The event operations are designed for single-threaded use on one
    executor. The stop callback may fire from any thread.

    This type is non-copyable and non-movable because suspended
    waiters hold intrusive pointers into the event's internal list.

    @par Example
    @code
    async_event event;

    task<> waiter() {
        auto [ec] = co_await event.wait();
        if(ec)
            co_return;
        // ... event was set ...
    }

    task<> notifier() {
        // ... do some work ...
        event.set();  // Wake all waiters
    }
    @endcode

            If a stop request is already pending on `env->stop_token`, the
            awaiter records the cancellation and does not enqueue.

            Otherwise it stores `h` and `env->executor`, links itself into
            the event's wait queue, and registers a stop callback on
            `env->stop_token`. Exactly one of `set()` and that callback posts
            `h` through the stored executor, whichever claims the waiter
            first. Only the post is subject to that race. A losing stop
            callback does nothing at all, but `set()` unlinks every waiter it
            pops whether it claims it or not. That is why @ref await_resume
            unlinks a canceled waiter only when it is still linked.

            @param h The awaiting coroutine, resumed when the event is set
            or the wait is canceled.

            @param env The execution environment. Its executor posts the
            resumption and its stop token is watched for the duration of
            the wait. It must outlive the wait.

            @return `h` if a stop request was already pending, which
            resumes the awaiting coroutine immediately without enqueuing
            it. Otherwise `std::noop_coroutine()`, which leaves the
