/** RAII guard that keeps an executor's context from completing.

    This class holds "work" on an executor, preventing the associated
    execution context's `run()` function from returning due to lack of
    work. It calls `on_work_started()` on construction and
    `on_work_finished()` on destruction, ensuring proper work tracking.

    The guard is useful when you need to keep an execution context
    running while waiting for external events or when work will be
    posted later.

    @par RAII Semantics

    @li Construction calls `ex.on_work_started()`.
    @li Destruction calls `ex.on_work_finished()` if `owns_work()`.
    @li Copy construction creates a new work reference (calls
        `on_work_started()` again).
    @li Move construction transfers ownership without additional calls.

    @par Thread Safety

    Distinct objects may be accessed concurrently. Access to a single
    object requires external synchronization.

    @par Example
    @code
    io_context ctx;

    // Keep context running while we set things up
    auto guard = make_work_guard(ctx);

    std::thread t([&ctx]{ ctx.run(); });

    // ... post work to ctx ...

    // Allow context to complete when work is done
    guard.reset();

    t.join();
    @endcode

    @note The executor is returned by reference, allowing callers to
    manage the executor's lifetime directly. This is essential in
    coroutine-first designs where the executor often outlives individual
    coroutine frames.

    @tparam Ex A type satisfying the Executor concept.
