/*  async_mutex implementation notes
    ================================

    Waiters form a doubly-linked intrusive list (fair FIFO). lock_awaiter
    inherits intrusive_list<lock_awaiter>::node; the list is owned by
    async_mutex::waiters_.

    Cancellation via stop_token
    ---------------------------
    A std::stop_callback is registered in await_suspend. Two actors can
    race to resume the suspended coroutine: unlock() and the stop callback.
    An atomic bool `claimed_` resolves the race -- whoever does
    claimed_.exchange(true) and reads false wins. The loser does nothing.

    The stop callback calls ex_.post(h_). The stop_callback is
    destroyed later in await_resume. cancel_fn touches no members
    after post returns (same pattern as delete-this).

    unlock() pops waiters from the front. If the popped waiter was
    already claimed by the stop callback, unlock() skips it and tries
    the next. await_resume removes the (still-linked) canceled waiter
    via waiters_.remove(this).

    The stop_callback lives in a union to suppress automatic
    construction/destruction. Placement new in await_suspend, explicit
    destructor call in await_resume and ~lock_awaiter.

    Member ordering constraint
    --------------------------
    The union containing stop_cb_ must be declared AFTER the members
    the callback accesses (h_, ex_, claimed_, canceled_). If the
    stop_cb_ destructor blocks waiting for a concurrent callback, those
    members must still be alive (C++ destroys in reverse declaration
    order).

    active_ flag
    ------------
    Tracks both list membership and stop_cb_ lifetime (they are always
    set and cleared together). Used by the destructor to clean up if the
    coroutine is destroyed while suspended (e.g. execution_context
    shutdown).

    Cancellation scope
    ------------------
    Cancellation only takes effect while the coroutine is suspended in
    the wait queue. If the mutex is unlocked, await_ready acquires it
    immediately without checking the stop token. This is intentional:
    the fast path has no token access and no overhead.

    Threading assumptions
    ---------------------
    - All list mutations happen on the executor thread (await_suspend,
      await_resume, unlock, ~lock_awaiter).
    - The stop callback may fire from any thread, but only touches
      claimed_ (atomic) and then calls post. It never touches the
      list.
    - ~lock_awaiter must be called from the executor thread. This is
      guaranteed during normal shutdown but NOT if the coroutine frame
      is destroyed from another thread while a stop callback could
      fire (precondition violation, same as cppcoro/folly).

/** An asynchronous mutex for coroutines.

    This mutex provides mutual exclusion for coroutines without blocking.
    When a coroutine attempts to acquire a locked mutex, it suspends and
    is added to an intrusive wait queue. When the holder unlocks, the next
    waiter is resumed with the lock held.

    @par Cancellation

    When a coroutine is suspended waiting for the mutex and its stop
    token is triggered, the waiter completes with `error::canceled`
    instead of acquiring the lock.

    Cancellation only applies while the coroutine is suspended in the
    wait queue. If the mutex is unlocked when `lock()` is called, the
    lock is acquired immediately even if the stop token is already
    signaled.

    @par Zero Allocation

    No heap allocation occurs for lock operations.

    @par Thread Safety

    Distinct objects: Safe.@n
    Shared objects: Unsafe.

    The mutex operations are designed for single-threaded use on one
    executor. The stop callback may fire from any thread.

    This type is non-copyable and non-movable because suspended
    waiters hold intrusive pointers into the mutex's internal list.

    @par Example
    @code
    async_mutex cm;

    task<> protected_operation() {
        auto [ec] = co_await cm.lock();
        if(ec)
            co_return;
        // ... critical section ...
        cm.unlock();
    }

    // Or with RAII:
    task<> protected_operation() {
        auto [ec, guard] = co_await cm.scoped_lock();
        if(ec)
            co_return;
        // ... critical section ...
        // unlocks automatically
    }
