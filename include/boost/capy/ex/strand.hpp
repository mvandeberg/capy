/** Provides serialized coroutine execution for any executor type.

    A strand wraps an inner executor and ensures that coroutines
    dispatched through it never run concurrently. At most one
    coroutine executes at a time within a strand, even when the
    underlying executor runs on multiple threads.

    Strands are lightweight handles that can be copied freely.
    Copies share the same internal serialization state, so
    coroutines dispatched through any copy are serialized with
    respect to all other copies.

    @par Invariant
    Coroutines resumed through a strand shall not run concurrently.

    @par Implementation
    Each strand allocates a private serialization state. Strands
    constructed from the same execution context share a small pool
    of mutexes (193 entries) selected by hash. Mutex sharing causes
    only brief contention on the push/pop critical section, never
    cross-strand state sharing. Construction cost: one
    `std::make_shared` per strand.

    @par Executor Concept
    This class satisfies the `Executor` concept, providing:
    - `context()` - Returns the underlying execution context
    - `on_work_started()` / `on_work_finished()` - Work tracking
    - `dispatch(continuation&)` - May run immediately if already executing in this strand
    - `post(continuation&)` - Always queues for later execution

    @par Preconditions
    A strand holds only a non-owning reference to its inner executor's
    execution context (for example a `thread_pool`). That context must
    outlive every post() and dispatch() call; posting or dispatching
    concurrently with, or after, the context's destruction is undefined
    behavior. To guarantee this, submit work through @ref run_async or
    @ref run. Their operations are work-tracked, so the context's
    `join()` waits for them. Call `join()` on the context before
    destroying it, rather than posting to a strand from an external
    thread the context does not track. Destroying the strand handle
    itself is always safe, including after the context is
    destroyed.

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.
    Shared objects: Safe.

    @par Example
    @code
    thread_pool pool(4);
    strand strand(pool.get_executor());  // CTAD deduces the executor type

    // Continuations are linked intrusively into the strand's queue,
    // so each one must outlive its time there. Storage is typically
    // owned by the awaitable or operation state that posted it.
    continuation c1{h1}, c2{h2}, c3{h3};
    strand.post(c1);
    strand.post(c2);
    strand.post(c3);
    @endcode

    @tparam Ex The type of the underlying executor. Must
        satisfy the `Executor` concept.
