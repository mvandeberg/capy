/*  async_waker implementation notes
    ===================================

    wake() must be callable from foreign threads (that is the whole
    point: the user's thread provides the timing). A waiter-side
    claimed_ flag is not enough there -- the
    waker has to dereference the waiter, and nothing would pin the
    waiter's frame between reading the pointer and claiming it.

    So the three-state st_ atomic is the single arbiter:

        empty --arm-->  armed --wake/cancel CAS--> empty
        empty --wake--> token --wait consumes--> empty

    Whoever wins the armed->empty CAS owns the resume and may
    dereference waiter_: the frame cannot die underneath the
    winner because the coroutine only resumes when the winner
    posts it. The loser never touches the waiter. When the stop
    callback wins, a concurrent wake retries, finds empty, and
    latches a token -- a racing wakeup is deferred, never lost.

    Serialized resumption is required: await_suspend keeps
    writing after the publishing armed-CAS (the stop_cb
    placement-new and active_ = true), so a wake/cancel winner
    can post the continuation while that tail is still running.
    The posted resume must be ordered after await_suspend's
    return, which holds on a single-threaded executor (the one
    thread is still inside await_suspend) and on a strand (the
    resume is a later turn, synchronized with the current one).
    A raw multi-threaded executor lets another worker run
    await_resume against those in-flight writes. async_event and
    async_mutex make the same assumption; it is stated explicitly
    here because wake() invites foreign threads into the picture.

namespace boost {
namespace capy {

/** A single-slot waker that hands one wakeup to a waiting coroutine.

    This is the escape hatch for timing and other external events:
    the user provides the thread and the clock, capy provides the
    suspension point. One coroutine suspends in `wait()`; any
    thread wakes it with `wake()`.

    A wakeup with no waiter present is latched as a single pending
    token, and the next `wait()` consumes it immediately. This
    makes the wake-before-wait race benign without any lock
    protocol. Multiple wakes collapse into one token.

    @par Cancellation

    If a stop is requested while the waiter is suspended, the wait
    completes with `error::canceled`. A wake that loses
    the race against cancellation is latched for the next `wait()`
    rather than dropped.

    @par Zero Allocation

    No heap allocation occurs for wait or wake operations.

    @par Thread Safety

    Distinct objects: Safe.@n
    Shared objects: `wake()` may be called from any thread.
    Only one coroutine at a time may await `wait()`. Await it only on
    an executor that never runs the coroutine's continuations
    concurrently: a single-threaded executor, or a strand over a
    multi-threaded one (the same threading model as `async_event` and
    `async_mutex`). Awaiting `wait()` directly
    on a multi-threaded executor is undefined.

    This type is non-copyable and non-movable because a suspended
    waiter holds a pointer into the object.

    @par Example
    @code
    async_waker waker;

    // user-provided timing thread
    std::thread th([&waker] {
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(100ms);
        waker.wake();
    });

    task<> waiter() {
        auto [ec] = co_await waker.wait();
        // resumed on the executor after ~100ms
    }
    // ... th.join() after the pool drains
