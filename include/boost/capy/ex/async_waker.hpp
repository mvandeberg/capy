/*  async_waker implementation notes
    ===================================

    wake() must be callable from foreign threads (that is the whole
    point: the user's thread provides the timing). A waiter-side
    claimed_ flag is not enough there -- the
    waker has to dereference the waiter, and nothing would pin the
    waiter's frame between reading the pointer and claiming it.

    So the three-state st_ atomic is the single arbiter:

        empty --arm-->  armed --wake/cancel CAS--> empty
        empty --wake--> token --wait consumes--> empty

    Whoever wins the armed->empty CAS owns the resume and may
    dereference waiter_: the frame cannot die underneath the
    winner because the coroutine only resumes when the winner
    posts it. The loser never touches the waiter. When the stop
    callback wins, a concurrent wake retries, finds empty, and
    latches a token -- a racing wakeup is deferred, never lost.

    Serialized resumption is required: await_suspend keeps
    writing after the publishing armed-CAS (the stop_cb
    placement-new and active_ = true), so a wake/cancel winner
    can post the continuation while that tail is still running.
    The posted resume must be ordered after await_suspend's
    return, which holds on a single-threaded executor (the one
    thread is still inside await_suspend) and on a strand (the
    resume is a later turn, synchronized with the current one).
    A raw multi-threaded executor lets another worker run
    await_resume against those in-flight writes. async_event and
    async_mutex make the same assumption; it is stated explicitly
    here because wake() invites foreign threads into the picture.
*/

namespace boost {
namespace capy {

/** A single-slot waker that hands one wakeup to a waiting coroutine.

    This is the escape hatch for timing and other external events:
    the user provides the thread and the clock, capy provides the
    suspension point. One coroutine suspends in `wait()`; any
    thread wakes it with `wake()`.

    A wakeup with no waiter present is latched as a single pending
    token, and the next `wait()` consumes it immediately. This
    makes the wake-before-wait race benign without any lock
    protocol. Multiple wakes collapse into one token.

    @par Cancellation

    If the environment's stop token is triggered while suspended,
    the wait completes with `error::canceled`. A wake that loses
    the race against cancellation is latched for the next `wait()`
    rather than dropped.

    @par Zero Allocation

    No heap allocation occurs for wait or wake operations.

    @par Thread Safety

    Distinct objects: Safe.@n
    Shared objects: `wake()` may be called from any thread.
    `wait()` must only be awaited by one coroutine at a time. The
    executor must never run the coroutine's continuations
    concurrently: use a single-threaded executor, or a strand over
    a multi-threaded one. That is the same threading model as
    `async_event` and `async_mutex`. Awaiting `wait()` directly
    on a multi-threaded executor is undefined.

    This type is non-copyable and non-movable because a suspended
    waiter holds a pointer into the object.

    @par Example
    @code
    async_waker waker;

    // user-provided timing thread
    std::thread th([&waker] {
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(100ms);
        waker.wake();
    });

    task<> waiter() {
        auto [ec] = co_await waker.wait();
        // resumed on the executor after ~100ms
    }
    // ... th.join() after the pool drains
    @endcode

            This is the @ref IoAwaitable overload of `await_suspend`.
            Unlike `async_event` and `async_mutex`, it has three outcomes,
            because a `wake()` from another thread can land in the window
            between `await_ready` and this call.

            @li A stop request is already pending on `env->stop_token`: the
                awaiter records the cancellation and does not arm.

            @li The waker's slot is no longer empty. Under the single-waiter
                precondition that means a wakeup was latched after
                `await_ready` looked, so the token is consumed here instead
                and the wait succeeds.

            @li Otherwise the slot moves to the armed state, publishing this
                awaiter to the waker, and a stop callback is registered on
                `env->stop_token`. Whichever of `wake()` and that callback
                wins the armed-to-empty transition posts `h` through
                `env->executor`. The loser does nothing, and a losing
                `wake()` re-latches its token for the next `wait()`.

            @param h The awaiting coroutine, resumed when the waker fires
            or the wait is canceled.

            @param env The execution environment. Its executor posts the
            resumption and its stop token is watched for the duration of
            the wait. It must outlive the wait.

            @return `h` in the first two cases, which resumes the awaiting
            coroutine immediately; otherwise `std::noop_coroutine()`, which
            leaves the coroutine suspended and returns control to the
